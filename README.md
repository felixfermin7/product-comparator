# Product Comparator

This project is a React application built with TypeScript and Vite. It provides a platform for comparing products based on various specifications, allowing users to view products in card or table format and switch between tabs for detailed information.

## Project Overview

The application fetches product data from an external service (`products-service`) and displays it in an interactive interface. Users can compare products, view specifications, and explore payment methods.

### Prerequisites

2. **Node.js**: This project requires **Node.js v20** or higher. Ensure you have the correct version installed before proceeding. You can check your Node.js version by running:
